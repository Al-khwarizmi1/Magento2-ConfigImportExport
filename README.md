ConfigImportExport
==================

This module provides new CLI commands for Magento 2 to import/export data in/from core_config_data.

This module is inspired by the awesome n98-magerun plugin "HarrisStreet ImpEx" by @SchumacherFM for Magento 1 which you can find [here](https://github.com/Zookal/HarrisStreet-ImpEx).

Functionality
-------------

This module is a work in progress and will be extended in the near future with more functionality.

Currently implemented is only the import of yaml files. Other file formats and export functionality will be added later.
